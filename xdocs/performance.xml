      Here are the timings of solving the 12x12 NQueens problem on
      my home machine (2.4GHz P4, WinXP, Sun JDK 1.5.0b2).  This test simply
      does simple logic operations.  It primarily tests the speed of node
      creation and BDD garbage collection.  The command line I used to test
      was:
      <br/>
      <code>java -ms320m -mx320m -Dbdd=<i>package</i> -jar javabdd_0.6.jar 12</code>
      <br/
      <table border="2">
        <tr>
          <td>Package      </td> <td>Time  </td> <td>Peak Memory Usage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>buddy        </td> <td> 77s  </td> <td> 150mb </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>cudd         </td> <td> 82s  </td> <td> 171mb </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>java -server </td> <td> 90s  </td> <td> 155mb </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>java -client </td> <td> 107s </td> <td> 155mb </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      Don't make any assumptions from these results about the relative
      efficiency of C and Java.  The Java source code is a direct translation
      of the C source code, and therefore there are many, many inefficiencies
      that would not be present if it had been implemented from scratch in
      Java.  At best, you could use this information as an example of the
      type of performance you would see if you directly translate a
      performance library written in C into Java.
